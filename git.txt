What is a 'version control system'?
Version control systems are a category of software tools
that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. 

Why Version Control system is so Important?
Software product is developed in collaboration by a group of developers they
might be located at different locations and each one of them contributes in some specific kind of functionality/features.
So in order to contribute to the product, they made modifications in the source code(either by adding or removing).
 A version control system is a kind of software that helps the developer team
 to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like
 who made and what change has been made. A separate branch is created for every contributor
 who made the changes and the changes arenâ€™t merged into the original source code unless all are analyzed 
as soon as the changes are green signalled they merged to the main source code. It not only keeps source code organized 
but also improves productivity by making the development process smooth.

Git is cool tool!!
