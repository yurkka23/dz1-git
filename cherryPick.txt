Git Cherry Pick
 
git cherry-pick is a powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits
 to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD.
 Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it 
to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes. 
For example, say a commit is accidently made to the wrong branch. 
You can switch to the correct branch and cherry-pick the commit to where 
it should belong.
